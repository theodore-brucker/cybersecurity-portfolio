            <h2>Discovering my path in cyber</h2>

            <h4><br>What did I do so far</h4>
            <p>
            After discovering my passion for coding and having run ins with malicious actors at a young age, I was inspired to go to college to learn more about computers.
            I was lucky enough to land an internship my sophomore year and later land a job as a SOC technician.
            This was exactly what I needed, a chance to see how security operations work in the real world.
            5 months after graduating, I have been improving via trial by fire, and also have a handful of certifications to prove my knowledge in the cybersecurity industry.
            However, I realize that career progression is not as simple as collecting pieces of paper.

            <h4><br>What I am going to do next</h4>
            <p>
            I have spoken with a few late career cybersecurity professionals who have given me some advice to keep in mind as I move forward.
            \"Keep your head down and don't ask questions for your first couple years, do good work and pay attention and opportunities will present themselves\" was a particularly powerful piece of advice.
            Other advice indicated more of the same, with some mention that it is okay to branch out and explore.
            I am continuing to educate myself, focus on doing good work and earning new responsibilities, and talking to people who have walked the path before me.
            </p>

            <h4><br>Coming soon</h4>
            <p>
            I intend to write a follow up piece to reflect on this post with a fresh perspective at some point in the following months.
